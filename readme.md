## Ideastrike

We want a tool where people can suggest ideas and others can actively refine and enhance the ideas over time. 

Once an idea gets enough interest to kick start a project, the other systems that we use  - at this point in time GitHub and Trello - should integrate nicely to automate the mundane tasks of project management.

The existing tools out there are decent at what they do, but we want something more customisable and extensible.

### Getting started

**Getting started with Git and GitHub**

 * [Setting up Git for Windows and connecting to GitHub](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/)
 * [Forking a GitHub repository](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)
 * [The simple gude to GIT guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/)

Once you're familiar with Git and GitHub, clone the repository and run the ```.\build.cmd``` script to compile the code and run all the unit tests. You can use this script to test your changes quickly.

### Discussing ideas 

* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/ideastrike/4f137b417201526045146b8a) - add ideas, or claim an idea and start working on it!
* [JabbR Chatroom](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) - discuss things in real-time with people all over the world!

### Libraries used

 * NancyFx
 * Entity Framework 4.1 Magic Unicorn Edition
